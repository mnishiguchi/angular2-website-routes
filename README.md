## packages.json

- Define tasks to watch our project, compile our source files and serve them up via a liteweight HTTP server.
    + The `-w` flag: shorthand for `â€“watch`
    + The `start` task kicks off our compiler while spinning up our web server via `npm run lite`
- Call `npm start` when we are ready to compile and serve our application.

```json
    //...
    "scripts": {
      "tsc": "tsc",
      "tsc:w": "tsc -w",
      "lite": "lite-server",
      "start": "concurrent \"npm run tsc:w\" \"npm run lite\" "
    }
    //...
```
